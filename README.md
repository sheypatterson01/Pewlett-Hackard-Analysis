# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview:
This analysis serves to create two tables: One that identifies employees who are eligable to participate in the mentorship program, and the other to show the number of retiring employees and thier titles within the company. In the mentorship program table we added employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title. In the retirement table we covered employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date.

## Results:
The table that determines the number of retiring employees and their position titles can be viewed here: [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/sheypatterson01/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/files/9193123/retiring_titles.csv)

The table that identifies employee who are eligible for the mentorship program can be viewed here: [mentorship.csv](https://github.com/sheypatterson01/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/files/9193105/mentorship.csv)

From these tables, we can see that there are four key takeaways: 

  1.) Almost a third of the retirees are Senior Engineers, while another third includes the rest of the Senior Staff.
  
  2.) As a result, Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions have the greatest priority when it comes to deciding which roles the company would like to fill.
  
  3.) Among those that are retiring, there are 1,549 employees that qualify for the mentorship program.
  
  4.) There are more people retiring than there are potential mentors, which means that the company would have to create an efficient program that can cover the disparity between the number of people retiring and the number of people who can be trained to fill these positions.



## Summary:
To determine how many postions need to be filled before the retiremnt wave begins to hit, we can create a graph to categorize the retirees into age groups. The company can hire (internally or externally) the amount of people that would be retiring in accordance to the year. Currently, we have a list of people who were born between 1952 and 1955. Therefore, we would have a different hiring quota for each of the following four years and so on.

If we look at the current projection of potential mentors and the amount of people retiring, we clearly do not have enough retirees to mentor the next generation of employees. Moving forward, we can create a query that gives us a list of people who are retiring at the end of each year. From there, the company can prioritize how many younger employees need to be trained to fill up the retired positions. It would also be beneficial if we created a query that grouped mentor-eligible employees into position titles. With this table, the company can plan the mentorship program in compliance with proper mentor to student ratios.
